# Password Generator

## Description
This project allows a user to generate a random password based off of certain criteria that they set.

## Usage
Users should press "generate password". They will then be given a number of prompts, where they can indicate the kinds of characters they want included in their password, as well as their desired length. Afterwards, they will be provided with a random password. If they did not choose any parameters, they will be given an error message and instructed to try again.
